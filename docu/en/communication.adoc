== Communication

=== Remote Procedure Calls(RPC) over http(s) (service entrypoints)

image:docu/images/rpc.svg[width=150]

==== Frontend 

The most basic communication in simpl4 is *rpc* over http. +
rpc can be performed both, declarativ and imperative.  +
There is a customelement for the declarative way.

[source,html]
----
 <simpl-rpc method="namespaceName.methodName" service="simpl4" params='{"key":"value"}' response="{{responseData}}"></simpl-rpc>
----

* The method name should always be preceded by the namespace name.
* The service is mostly "simpl4" and can be omitted.
* Params, the service parameter object, can be also expressed as JSON as in the example here.

There is also a javascript module: *simpl4.util.Rpc*, this does the same in an imperative way.



NOTE: Each service, defined in the serviceeditor  for "rpc over http", +
must begin with a "Direct" endpoint. image:docu/images/communication/rpcendpoint.png[] +
*This is a the service entrypoint.*

. the procedurename
. the procedure parameter(s)
. the return value(s)
. permissions (roles and user)
. the name used inside the buildingblock, if empty the parametername is used
. a  parameter can be optional
. the parameter type: string, integer, long , double, boolean, date, map or list.
. the place where the parameter is stored: header/property or body. link:local:docu-overview[see description of exchange].

=== Plain websockets

Websocket can be used to transmit bidirectional raw data. +
As opposed to 'WAMP', you must provide the protocol here self.


NOTE: Each service defined in the serviceeditor  for use with plain websockets, must begin with a "Websocket" endpoint. image:docu/images/communication/websocketendpoint.png[]

=== RPC and Pub/Sub with WAMP

WAMP is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:
*Remote Procedure Calls + Publish & Subscribe*.




NOTE: Each service defined in the serviceeditor  for use with wamp, must begin with a "WAMP" endpoint. image:docu/images/communication/wampendpoint.png[]

The "WAMP" endpoint mode can be configured as "publisher" or "rpc".

=== Publish/Subscribe and simpl4

In the context of simpl4 there is a very valueable usecase of Pub/Sub.

The processengine *publishes* her states.

A Website can *subscribe* to one ore more of this events and then react on this.

There are many events available.

.Here is the list in order to evaluate the possibilities:
[listing]
- Activity cancelled
- Activity compensate
- Activity completed
- Activity error received
- Activity message received
- Activity signaled
- Activity started
- Process cancelled
- Process completed
- Process completed with error end event
- Process started
- Sequenceflow taken
- Task assigned
- Task completed
- Task created
- Timer fired
- Variable created
- Variable deleted
- Variable updated
