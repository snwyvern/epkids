==== Remote Procedure Calls(RPC) over http

The most basic communication in simpl4 is *rpc* via http. +
rpc can be performed both, declarativ and imperative.  +
There is a customelement for the declarative way.

[source,html]
----
 <simpl-rpc method="namespaceName.methodName" service="simpl4" params='{"key":"value"}' response="{{responseData}}"></simpl-rpc>
----

* The method name should always be preceded by the namespace name.
* The service is mostly "simpl4" and can be omitted.
* Params, the service parameter object, can be also expressed as JSON as in the example here.

There is also a javascript module: *simpl4.util.Rpc*, this does the same in an imperative way.



NOTE: Each service defined in the serviceeditor  for "rpc via http", must begin with a "Direct" endpoint. image:docu/images/rpcendpoint.png[]

==== Plain websockets

Websocket can be used to transmit bidirectional raw data. +
As opposed to 'WAMP', you must provide the protocol here self.


NOTE: Each service defined in the serviceeditor  for use with plain websockets, must begin with a "Websocket" endpoint. image:docu/images/websocketendpoint.png[]

==== RPC and Pub/Sub with WAMP

WAMP is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:
*Remote Procedure Calls + Publish & Subscribe*.




NOTE: Each service defined in the serviceeditor  for use with wamp, must begin with a "WAMP" endpoint. image:docu/images/wampendpoint.png[]

The "WAMP" endpoint mode can be configured as "publisher" or "rpc".
