==== simpldate(schedule meetings) ====

=== Overview ===


==== The main aspects ====

* Process (with sub-process,message events and mail service task)
* Camel (creating a rpc api, showing how camel and activiti playing together)
* Form (embed in website)
* Webapp (Basic staffolding)


Main character: In this process, no usertasks will be used.
That's not possible, because an unknown number of participants are involved,
which also no users in simpl4 are.
Therefore the used Forms are designed as web pages.

* InitiateForm(initiate.form) starts the process.
* The voting page communicates with the process via rpc (final a message is sent to the  process)
