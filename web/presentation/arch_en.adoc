=== Distributed architecture ===

* simpl4 manages no session on the backend, this happens in the frontend. +
This makes it possible to route every request to an another simple4 instance.
* All data, including those of the processengine, can be stored in the OrientDB. +
The state of a simpl4 instance is thus exclusively represented by the database.
