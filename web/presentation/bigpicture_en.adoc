=== Activiti processengine

* Processes (workflows) are executed in the Activiti processengine.
* The processes are specified in BPMN2.
* A graphical editor (Modeler) is available here.
* Service tasks are delegated to the service engine.

=== WAMP *Web Application Messaging Protocol* ===

* Websocket Subprotokol registered by IANA
* Provides routed remote procedure calls (RPC) and PubSub
* WAMP consists of clients and routers (not be confused with the Camel routes)
* The procedures are registered on the router
* *simpl4* is WAMP client and router
* External equipment (or browsers) can register their services (procedures) and thereby are reachable from each other WAMP client. +
Incidentally, in this way is browser-browser communication possible!
