The specify the data flow from component to component. +
A Camel route corresponds to a procedure that registers on the WAMP router and is in this way reachable via RPC.

=== WAMP *Web Application Messaging Protocol* ===

* Websocket Subprotokol registered by IANA
* Provides routed remote procedure calls (RPC) and PubSub
* WAMP consists of clients and routers (not be confused with the Camel routes)
* The procedures are registered on the router
* Simpl4 is WAMP client and router
* External equipment (or browsers) can register their services(procedures) and thereby are reachable from each other WAMP client. +
Incidentally, in this way is browser-browser communication possible!
