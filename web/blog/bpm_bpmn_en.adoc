== Description

This is the first article of a series of articles concering the topic BPMN.


=== BPMN, what does it stand for?

The short form BPMN stands for Business Process Modeling Notation, and is a graphical representation for the determination of business processes in a workflow.
BPMN enables business process management, which is equally understandable for technical *AND* business users, but still allows for the representation of complex process semantics.

=== The purpose

The primary goal is to provide a standard notation that is easily understood by ALL stakeholders in the company.

To have a standard for modeling business processes for

* Economic analysts, who define and refine processes
* Technical developers who are responsible for the implementation of these processes
* Enterprise managers who manage and monitor these processes


=== A brief look at the history of BPMN

BPMN was originally developed by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI). It is now part of the "Object Management Group", for short OMG.
The current version of BPMN is version 2.0.


=== The BPMN 2.0 specification

The specification for the standard notation BPMN defines the symbols with which the various elements of processes are represented, what the symbols mean, and how they can be combined.

It thus it regulates syntax and semantics, whereby the

* _Syntax_ is the system of rules how the symbols may be combined
* _Semantic_ is defining the meaning of symbols and their relationships

By mapping a workflow in a process model, you also get a documentation that is understandable for the IT department and the department.


=== The small BPMN 2.0 - ABC


There are e.g. to name only the most important symbols

* Start and End Events 
* Activities executed by people or the machine
* Various branching options (gateways)
* Events such as e.g. events that occur during a process (Intermediate Events)

The so-called connectors (arrows) connect the individual elements AND, at the same time also represent the flow in a business process.


=== BPMN 2.0 and Process engine, a powerful duo

A process engine understands the BPMN 2.0, it is almost a runtime environment for existing process model, it executes the source code with all the associated attributes, input masks, and what else is necessary.

A process engine usually provides various functionalities, which would otherwise have to be programmed up in a complex manner independent of the chosen programming language.

So for example

* Where is the process right now?
* Which values were entered, and by whom
* And much more

=== Conclusion

The combination of both provides a standard for software development, which is equally understood by the technical department and the non technical department, and is supervisory documentation and "program".
