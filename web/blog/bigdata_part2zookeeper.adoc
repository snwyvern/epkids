== Big or Fast Data, Part two

This is part two  of a series of articles concering "Big Data" in an OSGI environment.

*link:local:blog_bigdata_part1karaf[Part one]*


All components are designed as *link:https://karaf.apache.org[Apache Karaf, window="_blank"]*  features. +
A Karaf container, created in the previous article is the basis for everything else. +
All things are supposed to be available as turnkey software components.

The second part is about *link:https://zookeeper.apache.org[Apache Zookeeper, window="_blank"]*, which is widely used in distributed projects, +
as *link:https://flink.apache.org[Apache Flink, window="_blank"]* and *link:https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka, window="_blank"]* described later.

It is a *link:https://github.com/ms123s/simpl4-addons[github repository,window="_blank"]* available with all the things described here and in the *link:local:blog_bigdata_part1karaf[previous article]*. +
Except java 1.8, no additionals are needed, everything is included.


=== Creating an link:https://zookeeper.apache.org[Apache Zookeeper, window="_blank"]  Karaf feature.

.Apache zookeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications.

==== What Is ZooKeeper?

ZooKeeper is a coordination service for distributed systems. By providing a robust implementation of a few basic operations, ZooKeeper simplifies the implementation of many advanced patterns in distributed systems.

ZooKeeper as a Distributed File System. +
One way of getting to know ZooKeeper is to think of it as a distributed file system. In fact, the way information in ZooKeeper is organized is quite similar to a file system.

===== What does Zookeeper?

* *Flink and Zookeeper:* +
Flink leverages ZooKeeper for distributed coordination between all running JobManager instances. ZooKeeper is a separate service from Flink, which provides highly reliable distributed coordination via leader election and light-weight consistent state storage. 

* *Kafka and Zookeeper:* +
Kafka uses Zookeeper for storing variety of configurations as Key,Value in the Zookeeper data tree and use them across the cluster in a distributed fashion.

===== Zookeeper and OSGI

Zookeeper already exists as an osgi bundle. +

.however, a BundleActivator(starting zookeeper) is required. see also here link:https://github.com/ms123s/simpl4-addons/tree/master/ZookeeperService[ZookeeperService,window="_blank"]

<1> The class extends ZooKeeperServerMain and implements the BundleActivator interface.
<2> In the *start* method, the zookeeper thread is launched. *start* is part of the BundleActivator interface
<2> In the *stop* method, zookeeper is shutdown. *stop* is part of the BundleActivator interface
<4> Reading the config properties file
<5> The zookeeper service runs in  its own thread

{sp} +

===== Configuration

The Zookeeper configuration is stored in *etc/zookeeper.properties*

===== Testing

A Zookeeper client is required to test.
[source,bash]
----
wget http://apache.lauf-forum.at/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.9/zookeeper-3.4.9.tar.gz
tar xfz zookeeper-3.4.9.tar.gz
cd zookeeper-3.4.9

#make shure karaf with the "Zookeeper feature" is running.

#localhost:2181 is default, you can omit it
bin/zkCli.sh -server localhost:2181

Now you can try various things, maybe you look here at *link:https://www.tutorialspoint.com/zookeeper/zookeeper_cli.htm[Tutorialspoint, window="_blank"]*

Here is a *link:https://github.com/ms123s/simpl4-addons/tree/master/Examples/kafka-flink[example,window="_blank"]* , but the interplay flink/kafka/zookeeper  is a bit complex and will be described later.
