== Filter ==

A _Filter_ is a query, that is defined one time, and that then can be used in different places in simpl4.
It has input-parameters and a result as a output.

=== Usage in processes and services

In the following you can see a defined _Filter_, and how it is used in a process in simpl4.

After creating a _Filter_, the first point is to select the classes and the fields of the classes you want to use.
Here have to be selected the fields for the search and the fields for result set.

Next step is to define the _parameter name_ (in this case name) to its value the query within the records has to be done. 
Here it means: select all records which _include_ the value of the parameter _name_ in the field _name_ of the class _driver_.

In the result set are all records listed, because the parameter _name_ has no value.
