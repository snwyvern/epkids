== How to make the Webfrontend available ==

When you already have entities, they should be able to be managed (crud) via a web frontend.
Therefore a small HTML-file has to be created, in which the class is adressed.

The file can be placed under Main/Project in the folder *web* or in other created folders, also with a strcture.

Here the example _fahrer.html_ from the Demo-Application kfzplan

<div >
    <simpl-crud namespace="kfzplan" entity="fahrer"></simpl-crud>
</div>

After having done this, it has to be added to the menu.yaml  (http://www.yaml.org/start.html)

- name: data.fahrer
  icon: inbox
  url: fahrer.html
  hash: fahrer
  

In this example the URl is http://www.simpl4.org/repo/kfzplan/start.html

_repo_ means that the call goes to the repository
_kfzplan_ is the name of the adressed repository 
_start.html_ is the startpage
