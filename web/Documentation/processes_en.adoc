== Processes ==

In the real world many things have to be done or to be decided within complex or less complex workflows, also named processes.
One could be, if for e.g a customer wants to buy a car, and he needs to finance it at a bank.
Now from the start of the request several Informations of and about him, have to be captured and to be checked, perhaps of 
different persons, which have to make decicions for example depending from the amount he has to finance.
And at the of the process, which can be a few days or weeks later, and when all tasks have been done, the customer gets the information, if his requesr was accepted or rejected.

To represent a process like the discribed in a software application, with normal programming languages a huge effort is nessecary.
In simpl4 this can be implemented in a much easier way AND with various advanteges like for example the already monitoring 
possibility (checking at each time how the status of the process is) 

Therefore are various components implented
- a visual editor for BPMN 2.0
- a process engine that "runs" BPMN 2.0
- a integration engine which for example executes services (tasks) for the process engine
- more editors to create forms, rules, .... 


Here you can see how it is used
