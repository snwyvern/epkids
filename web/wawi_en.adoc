[TIP]
.*How it works ?*
====
image:web/images/simplflow.svg[width=100] *is based on image:web/images/logo-flach.svg[width=65].* +
Thus, operations such as e.g. the creation of invoices and the corresponding monitoring of payments, possibly necessary reminders, +
are shown in the form of process models. 
These are executed in the process engine of image:web/images/logo-flach.svg[width=65], +
which then places the task in the appropriate task compartment for the responsible persons, +
whether a particular person or a group of responsible persons.

Tasks assigned to the process engine by persons or groups are set in the dashboard for viewing and execution.

It is also possible to see visually, at what point a sequence is standing, and what the next step is, or even where it hangs.

=== Creating templates for your needs ===


You decide where exactly your company data, your company logo or others, in the invoice, and order or other templates, are placed.

The defined rules can be customized by you at any time.
For example, if tasks are performed based on specific parameters, or are assigned to specific roles, you can adjust these parameters and roles at any time.

[TIP]
.Example:
====
Up to a purchase value of 1.000,-Euro, the clerk can freely order, + 
from 1.001,-Euro the order goes to the purchasing manager, +
which then has to release or reject the order. +
You can adjust these parameters yourself at any time.
====

Defined rules as well as processes are executed by an engine, in this case by the rules engine.
